#Data was imported from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data
#The csv can be read on in the 'data' folder. However, I find it's easier for now to implement the following code in the main code:


import kagglehub
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("yasserh/titanic-dataset")
print("Path to dataset files:", path)
